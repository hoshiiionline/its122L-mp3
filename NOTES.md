# todin ideas for website
- consist of the following webpages
    1. user-side pages:
        - navbar: 
            - home (default page, shows some part of news page, else shows welcome (?)), 
            - news (tentative, expanded side of home, shows articles pulled from other sites regarding horroscope), 
            - zodiac signs (shows information for each sign)
            - login/register
            - profile
            - logout
        - zodiac sings page
            - iniisip ko interactable image ng zodiac wheel tas kada pindot redirect sa sign? medyo mahirap, if di natin kaya mag grid-layout nalang tayo hahaha
        - profile
            - shows basic information of user requested during registration (i.e. full name, gender, etc.)
            - displays zodiac sign, along w other information
            - if user is guest (i.e. not logged in), prompt to register
        - register
            - request for the following:
                - first name
                - last name
                - nickname / username
                - sex
                - gender
                - birthday
                - email
                - password
    2. admin-side pages;
        - view users ?
            - display information of all users
        - view signs
            - make changes to database linked to zodiac signs (?)
        - view as user (previews site as if admin were a user)
